The project is confirmed to not trigger a traditional CUREC review. Legal and ethical aspects are considered for the project design. Recreating a person’s voice is at the intersection of copyright, impersonation and property rights. There has been precedent in the US [1] regarding this topic. To address the legal aspects, there is a fair-use exemption [2] that applies to the project. The project is for non-commercial research purposes and all music will be obtained legally i.e. paid for and downloaded through legal avenues. As the project creates deepfakes, without the singer’s consent or knowledge, the project has ethical implications. As it is difficult to connect with the singer’s selected for the project, a few additional constraints will be applied to the project.

1. Converting maximum of 50 seconds only of the song to simply test the software, rather than deliver a fully converted audio.
2. Making it clear within the tool that the conversion is for personal use only, not for publishing or distribution.
3. Results are to be stored in github repository for showing them to the reviewers.
4. Stating the project is for academic purposes only, only showing the codes and results of some seconds.
